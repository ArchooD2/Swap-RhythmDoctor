Aspiring to be a bartender, Swap!Cole takes his craft seriously, experimenting with various drink mixes and concoctions. He harbors a slight tobacco addiction, which he views as both a bad habit and a source of creative inspiration. Despite his occasional edginess, he has a warm, personable demeanor that draws others to him, particularly Nicole, with whom he shares a mutual, albeit complicated, interest.
