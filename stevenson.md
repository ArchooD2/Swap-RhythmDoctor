title: Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson (Spencer and Stacy Stevenson)
---

In this universe, Mrs. Stevenson is the one who broke her leg instead of Mr. Stevenson. Otherwise, their lives are remarkably similar to their classic counterparts. They share the same dynamic, with Mr. Stevenson doting on his wife as she recovers, their roles slightly adjusted to reflect the change in who needs care.
