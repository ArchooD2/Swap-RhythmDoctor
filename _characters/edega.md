As the manager who guides the player through Tutorial Missions, Swap!Edegaâ€™s priorities are always patient-centric. He believes in nurturing the well-being of every patient, sometimes to the point of neglecting his own team. His oversight isn't intentional but stems from a deep sense of duty toward his work. While he's empathetic, his tunnel vision focus on patient care sometimes creates tension between him and his subordinates, particularly when they feel overworked.
