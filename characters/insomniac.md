title: Swap!Insomniac
---

Swap!Insomniac experiences sudden episodes of sleep apnea, which can strike unexpectedly. These episodes leave them fatigued and somewhat disoriented, creating challenges in their day-to-day life. The struggle with this condition makes them a bit more introspective and quiet than their classic counterpart. Despite the difficulties, they maintain a strong will to push through, often carrying a portable CPAP machine as a precaution.
