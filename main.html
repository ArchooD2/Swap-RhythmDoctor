    <h1>Swap!RhythmDoctor Headcanons</h1>

    <section id="samurai">
        <h2>Swap!Samurai</h2>
        <p>Almost identical to their classic counterpart, Swap!Samurai carries the same calm and stoic demeanor but shows a slightly more relaxed attitude when it comes to social interactions. In group settings, they occasionally contribute to conversations, offering brief but insightful remarks, contrasting with their typical reserved nature. This added comfort helps ease the tension in high-pressure situations, making them a bit more approachable to others.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="insomniac">
        <h2>Swap!Insomniac</h2>
        <p>Swap!Insomniac experiences sudden episodes of sleep apnea, which can strike unexpectedly. These episodes leave them fatigued and somewhat disoriented, creating challenges in their day-to-day life. The struggle with this condition makes them a bit more introspective and quiet than their classic counterpart. Despite the difficulties, they maintain a strong will to push through, often carrying a portable CPAP machine as a precaution.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ian">
        <h2>Swap!Ian</h2>
        <p>Swap!Ian shoulders longer work shifts than his counterpart, Ada, mainly due to a lack of external commitments. Outside of his professional life, he spends most of his free time in his Animal Crossing: New Horizons world, escaping into a realm of virtual tranquility. This escapism contrasts with his diligent work ethic, making his life appear lopsided: a dedicated worker who has yet to find balance between work and leisure.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ada">
        <h2>Swap!Ada</h2>
        <p>Swap!Ada frequently deals with family obligations, which often pull her away from work. However, when she’s on duty, she tackles the bulk of responsibilities, managing tasks with unwavering determination. This dedication, however, takes a toll on her, as she balances her job with the demands of her family life. Despite her no-nonsense attitude at work, she shows a softer side when discussing family matters with her colleagues.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ian-ada-joint">
        <h2>Swap!Ian and Swap!Ada (Joint)</h2>
        <p>Both Swap!Ian and Swap!Ada uphold a stringent standard for their work, refusing to compromise on quality. This perfectionist mindset sometimes leads them to clash over minor details, and it can also wear them down. Their inflexible standards, though productive, can make them seem tough to work with, especially for their supervisor, Swap!Edega.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="edega">
        <h2>Swap!Edega</h2>
        <p>As the manager who guides the player through Tutorial Missions, Swap!Edega’s priorities are always patient-centric. He believes in nurturing the well-being of every patient, sometimes to the point of neglecting his own team. His oversight isn't intentional but stems from a deep sense of duty toward his work. While he's empathetic, his tunnel vision focus on patient care sometimes creates tension between him and his subordinates, particularly when they feel overworked.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="nicole">
        <h2>Swap!Nicole</h2>
        <p>An EDM producer rather than a D&B/hip-hop artist, Swap!Nicole brings a more energetic, rhythmic vibe to her compositions. However, her dependency on alcohol reveals a turbulent personal life hidden behind her upbeat music. In public, she presents herself as an intense and passionate artist, but behind closed doors, she struggles with her insecurities, using alcohol as a coping mechanism.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="cole">
        <h2>Swap!Cole</h2>
        <p>Aspiring to be a bartender, Swap!Cole takes his craft seriously, experimenting with various drink mixes and concoctions. He harbors a slight tobacco addiction, which he views as both a bad habit and a source of creative inspiration. Despite his occasional edginess, he has a warm, personable demeanor that draws others to him, particularly Nicole, with whom he shares a mutual, albeit complicated, interest.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="miner">
        <h2>Swap!Miner</h2>
        <p>Swap!Miner takes on the role of an American football player, embodying the gritty determination often associated with the sport. His connection to the “gold rush” reflects the hard work and rugged persistence of his San Francisco 49ers inspiration. Outside of the game, he displays a camaraderie with Swap!Lucky, though he’s oblivious to the complexities of Lucky's feelings toward him.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="lucky">
        <h2>Swap!Lucky</h2>
        <p>Working in a steel and textile plant, Swap!Lucky embodies a hardworking, blue-collar attitude. His job demands physical endurance, which has made him tough but not without his vulnerabilities. He values his friendship with Swap!Miner, but his feelings are complicated, stemming more from admiration and a sense of longing for something he hasn’t fully grasped. He often brushes these feelings aside, unsure of how to process them.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="birds">
        <h2>The Birds</h2>
        <p>Unchanged across every universe, the birds remain a constant. They transcend the boundaries of space and time, serving as a peculiar anchor to the world’s varying realities.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="stevensons">
        <h2>Mr. and Mrs. Stevenson (Spencer and Stacy Stevenson)</h2>
        <p>In this universe, Mrs. Stevenson is the one who broke her leg instead of Mr. Stevenson. Otherwise, their lives are remarkably similar to their classic counterparts. They share the same dynamic, with Mr. Stevenson doting on his wife as she recovers, their roles slightly adjusted to reflect the change in who needs care.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="logan-hailey">
        <h2>Logan & Hailey</h2>
        <p>While their relationship mirrors that of the classic universe, there are some key differences. In Act 4, it is Logan who takes center stage rather than Hailey, subtly shifting the story’s emotional focus. Hailey, while still deeply in love with Logan, is shy about her feelings and tends to keep her affection more reserved. This adds an undercurrent of tension to their interactions, as Logan is less aware of Hailey's internal struggles.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="farmer">
        <h2>Swap!Farmer (Howie Rich)</h2>
        <p>Now a politician and major benefactor of Swap!Middlesea, Howie Rich channels his wealth and influence into promoting farming as the backbone of society. He presents himself as a rustic, down-to-earth individual, often referencing his background to justify his decisions. Boastful and self-assured, he’s quick to assert his beliefs, but his focus on agricultural prosperity masks a shrewd, strategic mindset.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="richard">
        <h2>Swap!Richard (Howard)</h2>
        <p>Swap!Richard is a farmer who, despite his refined and polished appearance, lives a quiet, unassuming life. He avoids the limelight and confrontation, preferring to be left alone. His shy nature contrasts sharply with the aura of wealth he inadvertently exudes. People often expect him to be more assertive due to his appearance, but he surprises them with his reserved demeanor.</p>
