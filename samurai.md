title: Swap!Samurai
---

Almost identical to their classic counterpart, Swap!Samurai carries the same calm and stoic demeanor but shows a slightly more relaxed attitude when it comes to social interactions. In group settings, they occasionally contribute to conversations, offering brief but insightful remarks, contrasting with their typical reserved nature. This added comfort helps ease the tension in high-pressure situations, making them a bit more approachable to others.
