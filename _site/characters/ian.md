title: Swap!Ian
---

Swap!Ian shoulders longer work shifts than his counterpart, Ada, mainly due to a lack of external commitments. Outside of his professional life, he spends most of his free time in his Animal Crossing: New Horizons world, escaping into a realm of virtual tranquility. This escapism contrasts with his diligent work ethic, making his life appear lopsided: a dedicated worker who has yet to find balance between work and leisure.
