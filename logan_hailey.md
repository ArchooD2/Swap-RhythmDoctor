title: Logan & Hailey
---

While their relationship mirrors that of the classic universe, there are some key differences. In Act 4, it is Logan who takes center stage rather than Hailey, subtly shifting the storyâ€™s emotional focus. Hailey, while still deeply in love with Logan, is shy about her feelings and tends to keep her affection more reserved. This adds an undercurrent of tension to their interactions, as Logan is less aware of Hailey's internal struggles.
