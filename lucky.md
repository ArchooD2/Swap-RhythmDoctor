Working in a steel and textile plant, Swap!Lucky embodies a hardworking, blue-collar attitude. His job demands physical endurance, which has made him tough but not without his vulnerabilities. He values his friendship with Swap!Miner, but his feelings are complicated, stemming more from admiration and a sense of longing for something he hasnâ€™t fully grasped. He often brushes these feelings aside, unsure of how to process them.
